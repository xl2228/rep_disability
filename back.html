        When we write, speak or act out about disability or people with disabilities, we're
        in a process of transforming materiality into language (or rhetorics).
        Within this process, disability served as “a device of characterization in narrative art.”
        Narrative prosthesis, being the core concept here, describes the role which disability (or people with disability) were
        made playing. They are the "tool" of making a impressive story or a smooth transition.
        <br> <br>
        We could find a parallel between the concept of narrative prosthesis
        and Foucault’s analysis of transforming incitement into discourse in The Birth of the Clinic.
        Literary efforts to illuminate the dark recesses of disability produce a
        form of discursive subjugation.
        Abundant representations of deviances in disability stand between the physical,
        material body and idealized world of language expressions.
        <br> <br>
        To prosthetics, according to them, is to “bring the body’s unruliness
        under control.” (Mitchell and Snyder 2000) We’ve seen such cases on the
        front side. Normality is like the unspoken rule when narrators are portraying
        disabled characters, which Garland named as “cripsploitation.”
