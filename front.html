          prejudice and oblivion, however sight and vision usually represent
          intelligence, wisdom and prescience.
          <br>e.g. Thought for today: “A nation that keeps one eye on the past is wise.
          A nation that keeps two eyes on the past is blind.”

          Overcoming disability <br>
          Supercrip narratives rely upon the perception that disability and
          achievement contradict each other that any disabled person who overcomes
          this contradiction is heroic, pairing helplessness with disability.

          Physical disabilities typically involve disfigurement of the face
           and head and gross deformity of the body. These visible traits express
            disfigurement of personality and deformity of soul. It usually
            signifies loss of humanity.

        This genre capitalizes on physical differences in order
        to elicit amazement and admiration. Photography introduced into the
        rhetoric of wonder the illusion of fusing the ordinary with the
        extraordinary.

        The sentimental produces the sympathetic victim or helpless sufferer

        Trades in verisimilitude, regularizing the disabled figure in order to
        avoid differentiation and arouse identification, often normalizing and
        sometimes minimizing the visual mark of disability. Realism domesticates
        disability.

            The front side contains different ways of representation that stay on the superficial layer. What people see and read about disability representations can be located into several different but related categories, serving designated purposes in  stories and narrations. To start with, blindness is often connected with figurative languages describing “ignorance, prejudice and obliviousness.” Having the ability to see or look, however, metaphorically signifies “intelligence, wisdom and prescience,.” (Kleege 2018) Moving on, negative, symbolic tags related to disability are common in visual narratives. In motion pictures, disability or impairment are often portrayed as villains or “bad guys,” emphasizing the fixed, stereotypical impression of disability as “punishment for evil.” Moreover, as disability usually involves deformity and disfigurement of certain body parts, it then became the representation of monster characters who lose self control or humanity (being less humane) in popular narratives. Violence, failure of self acceptance and death often come as subsidiary elements which influenced how audiences would imagine disability. (Longmore 1985) <br><br>
            As distorted representations occupied people’s perception of disability, supercrip narratives focus on a more sentimental perspective. Supercrip stories emphasize the pitiful, tragic side of disability, internalizing the stereotype of disabled people being weak and helpless. People naturally unpair disability with achievement, believing that “any disabled person who overcomes this contradiction is heroic.” (Clare 2015) At the same time, this heroic narrative also brought pressure to people with disabilities since the expectation of them overcoming their “inferiority” and acting like “normal” people would do. Advertisements and charity campaigns liked to feature supercrip figures to create senses of empowerment, eliciting empathetic feelings. Rhetorics in photography resemble the pattern of representation in motion pictures. Wondrous representations capture people’s curiosity and imagination regarding disability; Sentimental approaches picture people with disability as “sympathetic victim or helpless needing protection or succor and [evoking] pity, inspiration, and frequent contributions.” (Thomson 2002) Realistic representations of disability minimize the previously exaggerated facets in disability. Integration of diverse bodies into visual rhetoric offered an opportunity for people to reconsider and reimagine the symbolization of disability. Though being less vivid visually, realistic portrayal of disability is still effective in terms of “dismantling the assumption that disability precludes accomplishment.” (Thomson 2002)
